# Review and Rating System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a bidirectional review and rating system for the fliQ platform, allowing both clients and companions to leave reviews and ratings for each other after completed bookings.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **Reviews Table**: New table structure to store reviews with the following fields:
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `booking_id`: Reference to the booking (unique - one review per party per booking)
  - `reviewer_id`: User who wrote the review
  - `reviewer_role`: Role of reviewer (client or companion)
  - `reviewee_id`: User being reviewed
  - `reviewee_role`: Role of reviewee (client or companion)
  - `rating`: Star rating (1-5)
  - `review_text`: Optional written review
  - `created_at`: Timestamp

- **Review Rules**:
  - Each booking can have up to 2 reviews (one from each party)
  - Reviews can only be submitted after booking status is 'completed'
  - Reviewers can only review the other party in the booking
  - Ratings are on a scale of 1-5 stars

### 2. API Endpoints

#### POST /api/bookings/[id]/review
Submit a review for a completed booking.

**Request:**
```json

  "rating": 5,
