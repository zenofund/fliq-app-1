# Automated Notification System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the automated notification system implementation for the fliQ application. The system sends notifications through multiple channels (in-app, email, and push) for key events in the booking lifecycle, messaging, and appointment reminders.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Notification Service (`lib/notifications.js`)

A centralized notification service that handles all notification delivery across multiple channels.

**Key Components:**
- Template-based notification system with 10 notification types
- Multi-channel delivery (in-app, email, push)
- User preference support
- Safe error handling (failures don't break main operations)

**Notification Types:**
1. `BOOKING_REQUEST` - New booking request notification
2. `BOOKING_CONFIRMED` - Booking confirmation
3. `BOOKING_ACCEPTED` - Booking accepted by companion
4. `BOOKING_REJECTED` - Booking rejected by companion
5. `BOOKING_CANCELLED` - Booking cancelled
6. `BOOKING_COMPLETED` - Booking marked as complete
7. `NEW_MESSAGE` - New chat message received
8. `APPOINTMENT_REMINDER` - Upcoming appointment reminder
9. `PAYMENT_RECEIVED` - Payment received notification
10. `PAYMENT_FAILED` - Payment failure notification

### 2. API Endpoints

#### `/api/notifications/send.js` (POST)
Internal endpoint for sending notifications programmatically.

**Features:**
- Authentication required
- Validates notification type
- Supports both user preferences and custom channel selection
- Returns results for each channel

#### `/api/notifications/reminders.js` (POST)
Cron job endpoint for processing appointment reminders.

**Features:**
- Protected by CRON_SECRET
- Checks for appointments in 24h, 2h, and 30min windows
- Tracks sent reminders to prevent duplicates
- Sends notifications to both client and companion

### 3. Integration with Existing APIs

#### Updated: `/api/bookings/index.js`
Integrated notification triggers for booking lifecycle events:
- **New booking created** → Notify companion
- **Booking accepted** → Notify client
- **Booking rejected** → Notify client with refund info
- **Booking cancelled** → Notify companion with refund info
- **Booking completed** → Notify both parties + companion receives payment notification

#### Updated: `/api/chat/messages.js`
Integrated notification triggers for messaging:
- **New message sent** → Notify recipient with message preview
- In-app and push notifications only (not email for every message)

### 4. Enhanced Pusher Integration (`lib/pusher.js`)

Added `sendMessageToUser()` function for generic user-to-user messaging, used by the notification service for real-time delivery.

### 5. UI Updates

#### Updated: `components/ui/NotificationsDropdown.js`
Enhanced to support new notification types with color coding:
- Booking requests/confirmations: Blue
- Booking rejections/cancellations: Red
- Booking completions: Green
- New messages: Green
- Appointment reminders: Yellow
- Payment notifications: Purple

### 6. Documentation

#### `docs/notification-system.md`
Comprehensive documentation including:
- System architecture
- Setup instructions
- Database schema requirements
- Email/push service integration guides
- Usage examples
- Testing guidelines
- Best practices
- Security considerations

#### Updated: `README.md`
Added notification system features section and updated environment variables.

#### Updated: `.env.example`
Added notification-related environment variables:
- Email service configuration
- Push notification service configuration
- Cron job secret

### 7. Testing

#### `scripts/test-notifications.js`
Test script to validate notification system setup and components.

## Database Requirements

The following database tables are needed (see `docs/notification-system.md` for SQL):

1. **notifications** - Store in-app notifications
2. **booking_reminders** - Track sent appointment reminders
3. **notification_preferences** (optional) - User notification preferences

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Email Service
EMAIL_SERVICE_URL=your_email_service_url
EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY=your_email_service_api_key
EMAIL_FROM=notifications@fliq.app

# Push Notifications
FCM_SERVER_KEY=your_fcm_server_key

# Cron Job Secret
CRON_SECRET=your_random_cron_secret_key
```

## Integration Checklist

To fully activate the notification system:

- [ ] Set up email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES, etc.)
- [ ] Configure email service credentials in `.env.local`
- [ ] Set up push notification service (Firebase Cloud Messaging, OneSignal, etc.)
- [ ] Configure push service credentials in `.env.local`
- [ ] Create database tables (notifications, booking_reminders, notification_preferences)
- [ ] Set up cron job to call `/api/notifications/reminders` every hour
- [ ] Configure CRON_SECRET for reminder endpoint security
- [ ] Test each notification type end-to-end
- [ ] Set up monitoring for notification delivery rates

## Key Features

✅ **Safety First**
- Notification failures don't break main operations
- All notification calls wrapped in try-catch
- Template-based system prevents infinite loops
- No notifications about notification actions

✅ **Multi-Channel Support**
- In-app notifications (stored in DB, delivered via Pusher)
- Email notifications (configurable service)
- Push notifications (configurable service)

✅ **Comprehensive Event Coverage**
- All booking lifecycle events
- New message notifications
- Appointment reminders (3 time windows)
- Payment-related notifications

✅ **User Experience**
- Real-time in-app notifications
- Email for important events
- Push for time-sensitive alerts
- Respects user preferences

✅ **Developer Experience**
- Simple API for sending notifications
- Template-based for consistency
- Comprehensive documentation
- Test utilities included

## Security

✅ **CodeQL Security Scan: PASSED (0 vulnerabilities)**

Security features:
- Authentication required for all endpoints
- CRON_SECRET protects reminder endpoint
- Input validation on all notification data
- No sensitive data in notification content
- Template-based to prevent injection

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Services**: Set up email and push notification services
2. **Database Setup**: Create required database tables
3. **Cron Job**: Set up scheduled job for reminders
4. **Testing**: Test all notification types in staging
5. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for delivery rates
6. **User Preferences**: Implement UI for notification preferences

## Performance Considerations

- Notifications are sent asynchronously
- Database queries use pagination
- Reminder processing is batched
- Failed notifications are logged but don't retry automatically
- Real-time delivery via Pusher is non-blocking
